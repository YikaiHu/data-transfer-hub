### Quotas for AWS services in this solution

Make sure you have sufficient quota for each of the services [implemented in this solution](../../architecture-overview/architecture-details/#aws-services-in-this-solution). For more information, see [AWS service quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html).

Choose one of the following links to go to the page for that service. To view the service quotas for all AWS services in the documentation without switching pages, view the information in the [Service endpoints and quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-general.pdf#aws-service-information) page in the PDF instead.

### AWS CloudFormation quotas

Your AWS account has AWS CloudFormation quotas that you should be aware of when launching the stack in this solution. By understanding these quotas, you can avoid limitation errors that would prevent you from deploying this solution successfully. For more information, refer to [AWS CloudFormation quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cloudformation-limits.html) in the *AWS CloudFormation User Guide*.
